# STEMitOn
Inspiration
It was important to us to encourage girls of all ages to participate in the STEM field as girls can be misrepresented in this industry. It's important to get different perspectives and drive girls in the right direction by providing resources and mentorship which was important to us throughout our Software journeys.

What it does
Our web application provides resources, technological tips depending on the level of education of each girl. The resources that are provides are catered depending on each education level, so users do not feel overwhelmed. Finally, we know that it's important to gain mentorship especially post-graduation, so we also implemented a chat box that mentors and mentees can connect to gain insights about the industry.

How we built it
We used domain.com, Twilio, and Firebase to create this website.

Challenges we ran into
Because we were new to Firebase and Twilio, we had to go through a learning curve in order to understand the functionality and implementation. However, with the assistance of mentors, we were able to overcome some of these obstacles, learn more about these platforms, and integrate their features into our website.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we completed a project with software that was completely new to us, and we challenged ourselves during this Hackathon.

What we learned
We learned how to use Firebase, Twilio. In addition, we learned about creating a website and how we can use other software to integrate into our website to make it more unique and user-friendly.

What's next for StemItOn
Increase functionality by connecting mentees and mentors in terms of design and function. We want to improve the design's usability and aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, in terms of functionality, we hope to provide a more intuitive and straightforward way for mentors and mentees to connect.
